The attitudes towards science for the CU people of 100 years later (Topic 3)
If I were the Director of the GEF programme, I would choose the following three texts, namely On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, DNA: the Secret of Life by James D.Waston, and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson. After studying the programme —Dialogue with Nature, I have figured out a few values which are worth lasting and showing to the CU people of 100 years later, for instance, the appropriate attitudes towards science. To be specific, firstly, even though we have such leading scientific development nowadays, we should never stop our pace on it while more importantly, we should never satisfy with the achievements we accomplished and continuing to strive for better and more completed results. Secondly, we should fully utilize scientific achievements but never at the expense of others goods, including the natural world. Each attitude will be explained with the support of texts.
Firstly, we should always crave for improvements and never stop our pace in doing scientific research so that we can continue to be one of the strongest species in the world. From text 4, we can know that all species on the Earth are come from common parent(Darwin 86), each species are only slightly modified forms, and tend to inherit those advantages which made from common parents(Darwin 89) which tell us that every species actually do not differ from each other much at first but through natural selection, which modify the structure of the young in relation to the parent(Darwin 77), so humans have a completely different structure from other species while also being one of the strongest. However, by natural selection, under competition which carried out from all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later states, that is between the less and more improved state of a species(Darwin 91)and the most severe between those forms which are most nearly related to each other in habits, constitution, and structure(Darwin 91), there is no guarantee that we can always be so, thus we may be eliminated by other species in the future if we do not keep improving ourselves. Therefore, in order to avoid humans from extinction, we must maintain our competitiveness in the world. In fact, one of the biggest differences between human beings and other species is we acquire the knowledge of science, for instance, in medical science, we discovered vacancies, surgeries, medicines to help humans for maintaining our body health which other species do not — by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved(Darwin 74)as long as humans are protected from various virus, we are better adapted to the environment. Therefore, it is true that science can help humans to win the competition under natural selection, thus we should keep taking advantage of it. Even though there are already many huge scientific achievements till now, we should never be satisfied with the status quo now, continuing to strive for better is what we should do, just like how James D.Waston, Morgan did in text 5.
What is more, the aforementioned attitude also can be found from text 5, such as scientists kept providing both new evidence or experimental result to further prove the existing result. Take the case in Pneumococcus as an example. For more than a decade Averys group had been following up on another most unexpected observation made in 1928 by Fred Griffith (Waston117).The Averys group even followed up a result which had already been proved a decade ago, which showed that scientists should always try to reinforce the past discovery with new evidence or clarify some misleading conclusion from the past, and that is the attitude we should learn from. In addition, in the case of DNA, if the scientist stopped at the first stage of the experiment, humans could not discover that there is a Double Helix (Waston 115)but even the differences between the DNA of boys and girls. This result is something that humans may never discover without further scientific experiments and scientistic proving. While in the case of Queen Victoria, we could know that girl is the carrier(Waston 108)of the bleeding disease(Waston 108),which mean girl herself will not get injected but she get one abnormal copy of chromosomes, which can pass to her son in the future. Victorias daughter did not get injected but her son Prince Leopold had injected(Waston 108), which told us that boys have a 50-50 chance of having a disease(Waston 108)and girls are the carriers(Waston 108). After having a better scientific understanding, humans are surely benefited by taking more precaution measures, such as arranging a detailed body check before having a birth plan so as to avoid inheriting genetic diseases to the next generation. Whenever there are new discoveries, humans get a chance to improve themselves. What is more vital is that we should never draw conclusions lightly towards science. From the case of James tried to show the viral death was caused by damage to phage DNA(Waston 121), even he had drawn the biological conclusion, he did not stop his work, he insisted to draw the chemical conclusion instead. Since we may find out some flaws from the conclusion in the past, we should not overlook any steps or any conclusion in the research. Rather than drawing conclusions hastily, we should ensure the conclusion is solid, in other words, we should pursue perfection because any little discovery could help people 100 years later for further study and obtain more improvements.
Besides, the way we utilize our scientific research is also worth discussing. In recent decades, humans have accomplished incredible scientific achievements, such as Artificial intelligence, biological technology so on and so forth; while there will be disastrous consequences if we misuse them. Take Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an example, researchers have found that if AI is keep being developed, multiple negative impacts will inevitably arise — as AI may keep accelerating and eventually forming a self-learning system that may exceed our ability as humans to follow along, we may lose control on it and even get dominated by AI. The above examples just show the importance of using scientific research appropriately or otherwise humans are the ones who are harmed at last. From the text, Silent Spring, the method blanket spraying (Carson152) had been adopted for eliminating weeds while herbicides used for spraying are highly toxic, including chemicals 2,4D (Carson 153) which disturb the basic physiological process of respiration in the cell, and to imitate X-rays in damaging the chromosomes. (Carson 153). In addition, it has been found that animals are sometimes strangely attracted to a plant that has been sprayed (Carson 153), while experiments showed that after treatment with 2,4D(Carson 153) there is a sharp increase in nitrate content of plants. When the animal feeds on vegetation containing abnormal high level of nitrates,. Death occurs within a few hours from anoxia or lack of oxygen.(Carson 154) As we can see, both plants and animals are being threatened by the chemical, but what worsens the case is that humans are also affected: When corn, oats, or sorghum containing large amounts of nitrates are ensiled they release poisonous nitrogen oxide gases, creating a deadly hazard to anyone entering the silo(Carston 154). Therefore, as seen, the misuse of our own discover not only causes us death but even damages our natural world. From what I have learned, humans live with nature, we eat products from the natural world, damaging it does no good to us at all. Perhaps 100 years later, with more advancing technology and scientific achievements, humans should never forget the one and only principle of doing any science research — we should use science to improve our living but never at the expense of any components from the natural world.
To be concluded, we should always take initiative to keep improving the scientific development to keep humans competitiveness in the natural world under natural selection. If humans stop paying effort on it, hardly could human adapt to the new environment, and we may end up extinct. On the other side, human should not overuse science, or it will bring tremendous drawbacks to us and the natural world.
